# StudySync (AI110 Tinker Starter)

Starter code for the AI110 **Tinker 1B / 2B / 3B** in-class activities. All three tinkers
build on this one project, each working in a different module.

| Tinker | Focus | Files you'll work in |
|---|---|---|
| 1B, Split the Logic | Writing your first `pytest` test, then a cross-file refactor | `scoring.py`, `scoring_helpers.py`, `test_scoring.py` |
| 2B, Wire It Up | Streamlit `session_state`, input validation, dataclasses, recurring dates | `sessions.py`, `app.py` |
| 3B, Rank & Explain | CSV loading, weighted scoring that returns reasons, ranking, a data-flow diagram | `ranking.py`, `data/study_spots.csv`, `diagram.mmd` |

## Setup

Fork this repo, then clone **your fork**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/ai110-tinker-studysync-starter.git
cd ai110-tinker-studysync-starter
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv-codepath
```

macOS, Linux, Git Bash or WSL:

```bash
source .venv-codepath/bin/activate
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\.venv-codepath\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Install dependencies and run:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

Run the tests:

```bash
pytest
```

## Files

- `app.py` — Streamlit entry point, wires the three tabs together
- `scoring.py` — `session_rating()` and the Session Scorer tab
- `scoring_helpers.py` — helpers extracted during Tinker 1B
- `sessions.py` — session log, the Tinker 2B surface
- `ranking.py` — study-spot ranking, the Tinker 3B surface
- `data/study_spots.csv` — sample data for ranking
- `diagram.mmd` — Mermaid data-flow diagram, completed in Tinker 3B
- `test_scoring.py` — starting point for your own tests

Your instructor will tell you which tinker you're on. Follow the activity on the course portal.

## Tinker 1B Reflection

The main issue was that apply_streak_bonus() was in scoring.py instead of scoring_helpers.py, and session_rating() didn’t have any test coverage. I accepted the AI suggestion as-is and moved the function to scoring_helpers.py, with no changes needed. The import and move worked on the first try. For the Part 3 breaker inputs, -10, 150, and 87.5 all returned a rating without crashing, so I didn’t consider any of them actual bugs for session_rating().
